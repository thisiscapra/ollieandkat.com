As the weather plummets below -20Â°C this week at our place near Ottawa, Ontario, the lakes are finally frozen enough to walk on.  So, of course, I am attempting to grow vegetables indoors in our loft skylights.  It has been a learning experience so far! A few things I've learned:

  - Skylights only get direct sunlight for an hour or so a day in winter
  - Snow covers happens, and only occasionally slides off, even on steep roofs
  - Indirect and ambient light still lets plants grow, albiet not well.

I have two windows growing now, one with shelves and a [3W LED growlight](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00ITH429G/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1420560217&sr=1&keywords=led+grow+light). Plants need red wavelengths to grow flowers and fruit and blue light to go bushy and strong.  You can get full spectrum bulbs too, which are cheaper, but they draw WAY more power and heat up a lot compared to than LED. Plus, it's nice to have a little red light in your life! :)

I was pleased to have a few tomatoes growing, nice lettuce and some radishes for harvesting before leaving to go to England for 10 days.

Luckily, I had someone come in and water twice, but my plants were pretty sad when I came back.  I tend to them every day, pruning and checking their water needs, so it is definitely not a low-maintenance endeavour! 

##What now?
New growth is happening after an agressive pruning (especially on my tomatoes, who have not made any progress on their fruit in the past few weeks), and I'm looking forward to starting some new lettuce, kale and radishes, as well as at least one more tomato plant!  Let's hope being near the window doesn't keep them too cool!
